The goal of the player is to get closer to 21 without exceeding it.
To do this, the player is dealt two cards which give a value, and the player has several choices:

- Draw a card: You wish to take another card, which the dealer deals you.
		            If the player draws and goes over 21, they lose their bet.

- Stay: You stay if you are satisfied with your hand, that the total is sufficient


- Double bet: You double your bet and receive one card, only one

- Split: If the player's first two cards are a pair, they have the option of splitting them into two separate hands,
             bet half the original bet on each and play them separately.
			 Any 21 rolled after a split does not count as "blackjack".

- Insurance:  The player may take out insurance to protect against a blackjack,
              This means place a bet equal to half of his initial bet.
	          If the dealer have a blackjack, the player wins twice the insurance plus the cost of the insurance
	          but if the dealer don't have it, the insurance bet is lost.

The dealer is the last player to act, and continues to play his hand like any other player after the players' turn.
If the dealer makes blackjack, he collects all bets, including splits and doubles,
except for players who also have blackjack.

If the dealer jumps, this means goes over 21, all players still in the game win.
Otherwise, players with a higher total than the dealer win and players with a lower total lose.
In the event of a tie, the player's bet is refunded.

Each card numbered from 2 to 10 has a face value.
Jacks, queens and kings (the tricks), have a value of 10 points.
Aces are worth 1 point or 11 points, at the player's option.
