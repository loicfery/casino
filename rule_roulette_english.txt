Roulette consists of 36 numbers ranging from 0 to 36.
The aim of the game is based on luck, you have to bet amounts on numbers and if one of them is winning
then you win your bet plus a multiplier depending on how you bet.

There are several ways to bet in order to win the rounds.

Game Options:

- The Full Bet: Here you bet on one or more numbers separately. When a number you bet on wins, you win 35 times the bet on that number!

- The Horse: This bet consists of placing one or more tokens astride two adjacent numbers on the carpet.
              If the ball lands on one of the two numbers on which your tokens are straddling, you win 17 times your bet!

- The Transversal: As the name suggests, this allows you to bet on a line of 3 numbers.
                    If the ball lands on one of the three numbers, you win 11 times your bet!

- Square: This bet consists of placing a token on four adjacent numbers (forming a square on the carpet).
             If the ball lands on one of the four numbers, you win 8 times your bet!

- Dozen: Similar to the Crossing, this allows you to bet on 2 adjacent lines, with 6 numbers in total.
                If the ball lands on one of the 6 numbers, you win 5 times your bet!

- Column (horizontal): Allows you to bet on an entire column (0 excluded). If the ball lands on one of the 12 numbers, you win 2 times your bet!

- 12P, 12M, 12D: These bets represent the first/middle/last 12 numbers respectively. Just like the column, you win 2 times your bet!

- Red/Black/Even/Odd/Miss(1-18)/Pass(19-36): Also known as single odds, these bets allow you to bet on either red, black, even or odd,
  miss (numbers between 1 and 18) and pass (numbers between 19 and 36). If the ball lands on any of these patterns, you will win 1x the bet!


WARNING: If the 0 falls, it cancels all the single chances! Indeed, the 0 being a number apart neither even nor odd nor pass nor miss, only this number will win!
